The project made by Yeva Zembytska. Here I am using the OOP technique to create the notebook for the nailmaster.
Here the master can write the name of the client, time for the appointment and choose the type of the procedure.
Also it shows the list of all clients, counts total time, average duration of procedures, and all money earned.
